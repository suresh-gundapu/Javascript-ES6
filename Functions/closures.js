/**Closures:
 * =========
 *
 *=> It holds variable/function value in Scope chaining

=> Global variable calling anywhere but in functional scope or block scope values cant call outside when calling outside it immidetly going to garbage callections


=> By using this closure concept we can store that values into another store and we can maintain scope chaining outside also  

=> Closures allow
you to access the scope (variables and parameters) of an outer function from an
inner function. Every time a JavaScript function is created, a closure is created.
JavaScript closures allow you to control which variables are and are not in scope in a
given function, as well as which variables are shared among siblings within the same
containing scope.
