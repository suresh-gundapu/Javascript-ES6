ES6 Features:
=============

ES6 = ECMAScript ==> 2015
6th edition 

1) Let and const keywords:
===========================

=> let and const are used to declare variables and we cant reassigning by use this both

=> both are used to overcome re-declaration problems 

=> in block scope if we declare var  keyword we can access outside block but if declare let and const we cant access outside block
this is leads to code security 


2) Arrow Functions:
====================

=> These are special type functions used to create function in jS

=> Reduce number of lines or syntax when compare to normal functions short syntax for function expression

=> don't use  function keyword  , use return keyword within expression if single statement no need curly braces also

=>arrow function dont have own this , so in object dont use this arrow function 

=> this is not hoisted , so before use we need to defined


3) Multi line strings:
======================

=> it allows multi line strings using back ticks by using template Literals

var x = ` sfsdfkk 
fsdsdfsdf
sdfsfsdf`;

4) Default parameters:
======================

=> some times when declaring functions and call arguments with passing parameters if we decalre parameters in function paranthesis but we dont send arguments 

through calling function leads to errors so overcome this we can decalre Default parameters in function 

let func  = function(a= 0; b =0){

}
func();
5)Template Literals:
====================
=> these are used to substitute individual variables to inside strings by using back ticks and string interpolation ${}

=> before old way we can use concantecate using + 

=> it allows multi line strings using back ticks

let x = "dfdsf";

let y = ` hi  this is ${x} of me `;

console.log(y);// hi  this is dfdsf of me 


6) Destructing , spread , Rest:
===============================




7) Object Literals:
=====================
Object Literals  are creating object and and create and access properties and methods very easily

const Obj = {

  x;
  y;
  func:function(){

  }
}


8) Modules:
===========
these are very usefule to react angular other frame works 

if export one file/module then we can exporting variable , classes , function to another module/file

if import we can imporitng which is exporting file of varables , classes, functions of module/file 

named export and default export is there 


1) named export 

x_file.js:
export const  x = {
  x:1,
  y:2
}
another_file.js:
import {x} from '/x_file';
console.log(x);

2) default export:
------------------
x_file.js:
const  x = {
  x:1,
  y:2
}
export default x;
another_file.js:
import x from '/x_file';
console.log(x);
